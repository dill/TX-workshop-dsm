# Spatial models of distance sampling data

- Collect spatially referenced data
- Why not make spatially-explicit models?
- Go beyond stratified estimates
- Relate environmental covariates to counts

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Motivating example

# Rhode Island loons




- Wind development off RI/MA
- Map usage
- Estimate abundance
- Estimate uncertainty

# Aerial surveys

- Record on dictaphone
- Transcribe later
- Glare an issue (roughly N-S transects)

# Aims

- Want to estimate abundance
- Distribution in space can be important
  - (Don't always have enough information to estimate this)
- What *correlates* with distribution?
  - Environmental covariates
- Still doing *distance sampling*!
  - Need to account for detectability

---

# Putting together distance sampling and spatial modelling

---

# Making our data spatial -- points

- Points
  - Know point location
  - Know number of animals seen per point

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="images/ptdsmproc.png" width=580px&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Making our data spatial -- lines

- Lines
  - Lines are **too long**
  - Can't use as sample units
  - *Segment* the lines

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="images/loon_segmenting.png" width=580px&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Including detectability

- Going back to *effective strip width*
  - think: *effective area*

- Effective areas are then:
  - `\(2 w l_j \hat{p}_j\)` for lines
  - `\(\pi w^2 \hat{p}_j\)` for points

How do we include this in our models?

---

# Building spatial models

- Want to relate *counts* per *sample unit* to covariates
- Covariates like: space, also environmental covariates?
- Spatial modelling using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
- 2 stage approach
  - get the detection function right
  - then model spatial distribution

# Generalised additive models


`$$\mathbb{E}\left(n_j\right) = \color{red}{A_j}\color{blue}{\hat{p}_j} \color{green}{\exp}\left[\color{grey}{ \beta_0 + \sum_k s_k(z_{kj})} \right]$$`

`\(n_j\sim\)` some count distribution

- `\(\color{red}{\text{area of segment or circle}}\)`
- `\(\color{blue}{\text{probability of detection in segment}}\)`
- `\(\color{green}{\text{(inverse) link function}}\)`
- `\(\color{grey}{\text{model terms}}\)`

# What are those s thingos?



- "Smooth" functions of (spatial?) covariates
- Could be univariate, could be multivariate

# How do we build them?

.pull-left[
![](talk_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

.pull-right[
- Functions made of other, simpler functions
- **Basis functions** `\(b_k\)`, estimate `\(\beta_k\)` 

`$$s(x) = \sum_{k=1}^K \beta_k b_k(x)$$`
]

Straight lines vs. interpolation
=================================

.pull-left[
![](talk_files/figure-html/wiggles-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

.pull-right[
- Want a line that is "close" to all the data
- Don't want interpolation -- we know there is "error"
- Balance between **interpolation** and **generality**
]

---

# Making wigglyness matter

- Fit needs to be **penalised**
- What should we penalize? How wiggly the function is!
- *Something* like:

`$$\int_\mathbb{R} \left( \frac{\partial^2 s(x)}{\partial x^2}\right)^2 \text{d}x$$`

- Estimate the `\(\beta_k\)` terms but penalise objective
  - "closeness to data" + penalty (REML?)

# Count distributions

.pull-left[

![](talk_files/figure-html/countshist-plot-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

]

.pull-right[

- Response is a count (not not always integer)
- Often, there are a lot of zeros
- Want response distribution that deals with that
- Flexible mean-variance relationship

# Tweedie distribution

.pull-left[
![](talk_files/figure-html/tweedie-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

.pull-right[
-  `\(\text{Var}\left(\text{count}\right) = \phi\mathbb{E}(\text{count})^q\)`
- Common distributions are sub-cases:
  - `\(q=1 \Rightarrow\)` Poisson
  - `\(q=2 \Rightarrow\)` Gamma
  - `\(q=3 \Rightarrow\)` Normal
- We are interested in `\(1 &lt; q &lt; 2\)`
- (here `\(q = 1.2, 1.3, \ldots, 1.9\)`)

# Abundance estimation

.pull-left[
- If we have covariates available over a grid evaluate equation

`$$n_p = A_p\exp\left[ \beta_0 + s_{x,y}(x_p,y_p) +\\ s_\text{depth}(\text{depth}_p) \right]$$`

- Sum grid cells for total abundance estimate

# Uncertainty estimation

.pull-left[
- Point estimates (even spatial ones) are not the end of the story
- Want to know how certain we are about our map
- Mapping uncertainty can help

# Selecting spatial covariates

- Complicated topic
  - What are covariates really *doing*? See later
- Several strategies
  - Stepwise AIC selection (path dependence)
  - "Shrinkage" type approaches
  - (Emprical Bayes)
- Often smooths of location are adequate
  - And keep you honest (extrapolation)


---

# Detection-level covariates


- Confounding between e.g., sea state and space important
- Pattern the same but abundance can change a LOT

# Summary

- We often collect spatially-explicit data
- There is information there to harness
- This *won't* solve all the problems you have

- Use 2 stage approach
  - First get your detection function right
  - *Then* do spatial modelling
- Spatial modelling is a multi-headed hydra
- Lots of things to think about
